This project goal is to help people summarize research papers. 

<br/>

It was started on the beginning of the rise of OPENAI and was created during a 2 day Hackathon "StartUp AI Hackathon" organized by NextGrid & New Native in which we won. 

<br/>

I kept working on that project alone after the original team disbanded and I was able to push far enough the project so that I got contacted by [ResearchHub](https://www.researchhub.com/).
